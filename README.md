### We ❤️ Free Audiobooks

**Youbook is audiobook application that was made with one single goal: filter the best audiobooks available on YouTube for free.**

I wanted to practise my foreign language skills, I decided search some audiobooks on Youtube for free. I found some, but I can’t save where I have stopped, minimise and the results always come mixed with other kind of videos.

My major issues with audiobooks apps and YouTube are:
* They are not free
* Cant minimize it (Youtube)
* Cant bookmark it (Youtube)


**Why are they using it?**

They use it because they want free audio books and the unique place that they can find it is on Youtube. However, they don’t have features on Youtube that help them to listen to audiobooks videos properly. On Youbook they find features that make it easy. 
Youbook is such a Youtube audiobook friendly

Which features do they like the most?

Being able to listening to it on background.
Being able to bookmark the audiobook video.
